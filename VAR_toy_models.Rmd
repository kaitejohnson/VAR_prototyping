This R markdown is meant to be used to explore VAR models to fit multiple types of data and multiple data streams, loosely inspired by the multi-species model presented in <https://ecoevorxiv.org/repository/view/5143/>

We will start by developing some simple toy models in stan to fit different types of data, for example ILI and ED visits for COVID, from different locations. We can eventually expand to apply to jointly fitting multiple wastewater data streams and multiple clinical data streams which may or may not be overlapping.
